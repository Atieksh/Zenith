# **Irrigation Requirement Calculator**

### 

### **Overview of the Project**



The Irrigation Requirement Calculator is a simple Python GUI application designed to help users determine the amount of water needed for agricultural irrigation.

By using basic environmental and crop-related inputs, the tool calculates:

* Reference Evapotranspiration (ETo)
* Crop Evapotranspiration (ETc)
* Net \& Gross irrigation requirement
* Total irrigation volume
* Number of irrigation events
* Water required per event



This project is ideal for students, farmers, researchers, and anyone working in agriculture or environmental sciences.



### **Features**

* User-friendly GUI built using Tkinter
* Real-time calculation of irrigation requirements
* Default values pre-filled for quick testing
* Lightweight (no external libraries required)
* Outputs displayed instantly
* Suitable for academic projects



### **Technologies / Tools Used**

* Python 3
* Tkinter (built-in GUI library)
* math module

No third-party installations are required.



### **Steps to Install \& Run the Project**

1\. Install Python

Download and install Python



2\. Download the Project

Clone or download the repository folder:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Irrigation-Calculator.git

Or manually download the ZIP file and extract it.



3\. Navigate to the Project Directory

cd Irrigation-Calculator



4\. Run the Application

python irrigation\_calculator.py



A GUI window will appear.



### Instructions for Testing

1. Open the application.

2\. Enter values in each required input field, or leave the default values:

Temperature: 30  

Relative Humidity: 60  

Wind Speed: 2  

Solar Radiation: 18  

Kc: 1.1  

Area: 10000  

Rainfall: 5  

Efficiency: 70  

Days: 7  

Max Irrigation Depth: 50  

3\. Click "Calculate".

4\. Observe the outputs such as:

* ETO
* ETc
* Net Irrigation
* Gross Irrigation
* Total Volume
* Number of Events
* Water per Event



If all values display correctly, your program is working.

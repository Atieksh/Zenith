### **Problem Statement**



Efficient irrigation is essential for sustainable agriculture, yet many farmers and students lack simple tools to estimate how much water their crops actually need.

Incorrect irrigation—either excess or insufficient—can lead to water wastage, reduced crop yield, and increased operational cost.

This project aims to solve this problem by providing a straightforward irrigation requirement calculator that uses basic environmental and crop parameters to determine water needs accurately.



### **Scope of the Project**

* The project covers basic irrigation calculations including ETo, ETc, net irrigation, gross irrigation, total volume, and irrigation event planning.
* It provides a simple GUI for easy data entry and instant computation.
* It is designed as an educational and practical tool.
* The project does not cover advanced modeling such as soil moisture dynamics, multi-crop simulation, or remote sensing integration.
* The scope is limited to small and medium farm-level irrigation planning.



### **Target Users**

* Students learning agriculture, environment, or civil engineering.
* Farmers who need a quick estimate of irrigation water requirements.
* Teachers and educators for demonstrating irrigation calculations.
* Researchers needing a lightweight tool for preliminary analysis.
* Agriculture extension workers assisting farmers in water management.



### **High-Level Features**

* GUI-based interface for ease of use
* Calculates:

&nbsp;	Reference Evapotranspiration (ETo)

&nbsp;	Crop Evapotranspiration (ETc)

&nbsp;	Net Irrigation Requirement								Gross Irrigation Requirement

&nbsp;	Total Irrigation Volume

&nbsp;	Irrigation Event Breakdown

* Default values for quick testing
* Lightweight and requires no external libraries
* Runs on any system with Python installed
